2014-10-13 v0.7.2.8
	lower bounds on parsec and haskell-token-utils
2014-08-20 v0.7.2.7
	Upper bound on ghc-mod until 5.0 is released and stabilises
2014-07-20 v0.7.2.6
	tokenise / basicTokenise moved to haskell-token-utils
2014-07-16 v0.7.2.5
	Fix incompatibility with haskell-token-utils 0.0.0.3, closing
	issue #14
2014-07-03 v0.7.2.4
	Re-architect to split out haskell-token-utils as a separate
	package, usable with haskell-src-exts too
2014-05-02 v0.7.2.3
	* Update for ghc-mod 4.1.0
2014-04-03 v0.7.2.2
	* Fix renaming so that it also renames types in the export list of
	a module
	* revert to ghc-mod >= 4.0, with note that FFI exports can't
	currently be processed
2014-04-01 v0.7.2.1
	* limit ghc-mod to <= 3.1.7, new version 4.0 does not deal with
	FFI exports. This does not stop ghc-mod >= 4.0 being used in the
	editor, it is just the library linked into ghc-hare
	* Added disclaimer that API is subject to change without notice
	* liftToTopLevel now brings along an updated type signature,
	provided there are no constraints on any of the types
2014-03-23 v0.7.2.0
	* Reorganised package structure to have
	Language.Haskell.Refact.HaRe which provides all the functions
	needed to call the refactorer from external code, and
	Language.Haskell.Refact.API which provides the interfaces to write
	new refactorings
	* liftToMod of last local decl having preceding comment now removes 'where'
	* Correctly determine the location for a demoted decl
2014-03-22 v0.7.1.7
	* Correctly determine what parameters to add when lifting a decl
	* Do not demote a decl if it is used in more than one match
2014-03-19 v0.7.1.6
	* Do not treat single-line layout as a group, hence preserving
	layout of adjacent let expressions when renaming.
	* Process Template Haskell expressions instead of blowing up
2014-03-17 v0.7.1.5
	* Adding parameters to lifted declarations now works as expected
2014-03-09 v0.7.1.4
	* Load and process files using TH and/or QuasiQuotes
	* Make loading of multiple targets from a cabal file more robust
2014-03-06 v0.7.1.3
	* Various fixes for robustness based on real world trials
	* Rework the free and declared variable calculation to be more accurate
	* Extend the range of syntax elements that HaRe can handle when
	reading a file.  Most bar parallel extensions are in place.
	* Make sure the refactored file retains its original extension, so
	that syntax highlighting still works while the preview is being done.
2014-01-28 v0.7.1.2
	* Ensure that the right target is activated for the primary file
	when it belongs to a non-library target,not just for client
	modules of it.
2014-01-27 v0.7.1.1
	* The non-library targets were having the wrong path prepended
2014-01-26 v0.7.1.0
	* Rework the module loading to load each target in turn, so that
	all exe, test, benchmark etc will be refactored in one go
2013-12-18 v0.7.0.9
	* Tweaks to output stage based on real world use. Renaming seems
	stable, liftXXX, demote have issues
	* Removed deprecated hspec-discover dependency
	* added ghc-hare show command to the elisp as well to be able to
	check that it is using the correct cabal file
2013-12-16 v0.7.0.8
	* Major rewrite of the token output stage. It now makes use of a
	dual-tree structure to manage the maintenance of required vertical
	layout while refactoring.
2013-10-21 v0.7.0.7
	* Bump the lower bound on Diff
2013-10-01 v0.7.0.6
	* Sort out most of the do/in/let layout when renaming. Only nested
	layout changes to be dealt with.
	* Updated to use the latest ghc-mod, with cabal 1.18.x sandbox
	support.
	* Updated to latest versions of Diff and hspec
	* When refactoring a CPP pre-processed file, read the preprocessor
	directives and non-compiled code as comments, so the source can be
	round-tripped. This allows refactoring of simple #if/#else/#endif
	code. NOTE: no refactoring is done on code that is not live after
	the preprocessor.
2013-09-12  v0.7.0.5
	* Now able to get tokens for a file pre-processed with CPP. But it
	is the pre-processed output, so the CPP directives are stripped
	out when writing out the refactored source.
	
2013-09-11  v0.7.0.4
	* Correct Haddock compile error. Close #4
	* hsWithBndrs only exists for GHC > 7.4.x
2013-09-10  v0.7.0.3
	
	* Fix elisp, would not commit refactoring due to missing methods
	
2013-09-08  v0.7.0.2

	* Fix issue #3: ifToCase formatting
	
2013-09-05  v0.7.0.1

	* Fix issue #2: elisp

2013-09-04 v0.7.0.0

	* Alpha release with new GHC API
